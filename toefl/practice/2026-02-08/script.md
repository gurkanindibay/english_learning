## Passage 1: Campus Conversation

### 🎧 Audio Script - Library Research Consultation

**Librarian (Female):** Good afternoon! How can I help you?

**Student (Male):** Hi, I'm working on a research project for my Psychology 301 class, and I'm having trouble finding sources. My professor said we need to use peer-reviewed journal articles, but I'm not exactly sure what that means or where to find them.

**Librarian:** No problem, that's a common question. Peer-reviewed articles are research papers that have been evaluated by experts in the field before publication. They're considered more reliable than regular magazine articles or websites because they've been vetted by other scholars.

**Student:** Okay, that makes sense. So where do I find these?

**Librarian:** We have several databases specifically for academic journals. What's your research topic?

**Student:** I'm looking at the effects of sleep deprivation on memory and learning in college students.

**Librarian:** Oh, great topic! For psychology research, I'd recommend starting with PsycINFO - that's the main database for psychology literature. We also have PubMed, which covers medical and biological research, and that would be useful since sleep and memory have biological components.

**Student:** I tried searching on Google Scholar. Is that good enough?

**Librarian:** Google Scholar can be helpful for getting an overview, but here's the problem - many of the articles you find there might be behind paywalls. Since our university has subscriptions to these databases, you can access the full text of articles for free through our library portal. Plus, our databases have better filtering options. You can limit your search to just peer-reviewed articles, specific date ranges, and particular types of studies.

**Student:** That's really useful. So how do I access PsycINFO?

**Librarian:** Go to the library website, click on "Databases," and you can search alphabetically or by subject. Once you're in PsycINFO, type in your keywords. For your topic, I'd try something like "sleep deprivation AND memory" or "sleep AND learning AND college students." The AND operator tells the database to find articles containing all those terms.

**Student:** Should I use quotation marks around phrases?

**Librarian:** Good question! Yes, if you want the exact phrase, use quotation marks. For example, "sleep deprivation" will find that specific phrase, whereas without quotes, it might find articles with "sleep" and "deprivation" anywhere in the text, not necessarily together.

**Student:** Okay, got it. And once I find articles, how many do I actually need?

**Librarian:** What does your assignment require?

**Student:** The professor said at least eight sources, and the majority should be from the last ten years.

**Librarian:** Alright, so you'll want to use the date filter in the database. Most databases let you specify date ranges. Since current research is important in psychology, focusing on recent studies makes sense. But don't completely ignore older foundational studies - if there's a really important paper from 15 years ago that everyone cites, it might still be worth including.

**Student:** How do I know if a study is important or foundational?

**Librarian:** Look at how many times it's been cited by other researchers. In PsycINFO, there's usually a citation count. If a paper has been cited hundreds of times, it's probably influential. Also, pay attention to where it's published. Journals like *Nature*, *Science*, or specific psychology journals like *Psychological Science* are highly respected.

**Student:** This is really helpful. One more question - can I access these databases from home?

**Librarian:** Absolutely! As long as you log in with your student credentials, you can access all our databases remotely. You might need to enter your university username and password, but then you'll have the same access as if you were here in the library.

**Student:** Perfect. Thank you so much!

**Librarian:** You're welcome! If you need more help once you start searching, we also offer research consultation appointments. You can book those online through the library website.

**Student:** I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again!

## Passage 2: Academic Lecture

### 🎧 Audio Script - Sociology: Gentrification

**Professor (Male):** Alright, today we're going to discuss a phenomenon that's been reshaping cities across the United States and really around the world - gentrification. Now, you've probably heard this term before, maybe in the news or in conversations about your own city changing. But let's dive into what it actually means and why it's such a complex and controversial issue.

So, gentrification refers to the process by which higher-income residents move into historically lower-income neighborhoods, leading to increased property values and often the displacement of the original residents. The term was actually coined by British sociologist Ruth Glass in 1964 when she observed changes happening in London neighborhoods. She used the term "gentry," which refers to the upper classes, to describe this process.

Now, how does gentrification typically unfold? It usually starts with what we call "pioneer gentrifiers" - often young professionals, artists, or students who are attracted to a neighborhood because of its affordable housing and perhaps its cultural authenticity or artistic character. These neighborhoods are typically close to city centers but have been neglected or underinvested in for decades.

These early arrivals might open coffee shops, art galleries, or boutiques. They renovate old buildings. And initially, this can seem positive - there's new investment, reduced crime rates in some cases, improved infrastructure. But here's where it gets complicated.

As the neighborhood gains a reputation as an "up-and-coming" area, more affluent residents start moving in. Property values increase. This is great if you're a homeowner - your property becomes more valuable. But if you're a renter, which many long-term residents in these neighborhoods are, your rent goes up. And we're not talking about small increases - in some cases, rents can double or triple within a few years.

**Student (Female):** But doesn't that just happen naturally in cities? Supply and demand?

**Professor:** That's an excellent point, and yes, market forces are definitely at play. But the issue is more nuanced than simple supply and demand. There are policy decisions involved. For instance, cities might incentivize development in certain areas through tax breaks or zoning changes. They might invest in public transportation or parks in these neighborhoods, which sounds good, but effectively makes them more attractive to higher-income residents.

The result is what sociologists call "displacement." Original residents can no longer afford to live in their own neighborhoods. They're forced to move, often to areas farther from their jobs, their social networks, their children's schools. And it's not just individual families - entire communities can be disrupted. Small businesses that served the original community often can't afford the higher rents either and have to close.

There's also what we call "cultural displacement." Even residents who can afford to stay might feel that their neighborhood no longer reflects their culture or values. The local grocery store becomes a Whole Foods. The community center becomes luxury condos.

Now, I want to be clear - gentrification isn't inherently good or bad. That's an oversimplification. Let me explain the competing perspectives.

Proponents of gentrification argue that it brings much-needed investment to neglected areas. They point to reduced crime rates, improved infrastructure, better schools, and increased tax revenue for the city. They argue that cities are dynamic and change is inevitable - neighborhoods have always evolved.

Critics, however, focus on the social costs. They argue that displacement destroys communities, particularly communities of color that have historically faced housing discrimination. They point out that the benefits of gentrification - the nice coffee shops, the renovated parks - primarily serve the new, wealthier residents, not the people who have lived there for generations. There's also research suggesting that crime doesn't disappear - it just moves to other neighborhoods where displaced residents relocate.

**Student (Male):** Are there ways to develop neighborhoods without displacing people?

**Professor:** Great question! This is where we get into potential solutions. Some cities have implemented what's called "inclusive zoning" or "affordable housing requirements." Developers are required to include a certain percentage of affordable units in new buildings. The idea is that neighborhoods can improve while maintaining economic diversity.

There's also community land trusts - where land is owned collectively by a nonprofit organization and sold or leased to residents at permanently affordable rates. This removes land from the speculative market.

Rent control is another policy tool, though it's controversial among economists. Some argue it stabilizes communities, while others say it reduces housing supply.

The challenge is that these solutions require political will and often go against powerful economic interests. Real estate developers and investors profit from gentrification, and they often have significant political influence.

There's also the question of whether we should be trying to prevent neighborhood change at all, or whether we should focus on ensuring that original residents can benefit from improvements. Some scholars advocate for what they call "equitable development" - investing in neighborhoods in ways that include and benefit existing residents rather than displacing them.

**Student (Female):** What about the artists and young professionals who move in first? Are they responsible for gentrification?

**Professor:** Another excellent question, and honestly, there's debate about this. Some argue that these "pioneer gentrifiers" are themselves often struggling financially and are just looking for affordable places to live. They didn't necessarily set out to displace anyone. However, others point out that even if the intentions aren't malicious, the effects are the same. Their presence signals to developers and wealthier residents that a neighborhood is "safe" or "cool," which triggers the economic processes we've discussed.

The key takeaway here is that gentrification is a structural issue, not just about individual choices. It's about economic systems, policy decisions, historical patterns of discrimination and disinvestment. Understanding these deeper structures is crucial if we want to address urban inequality.

Okay, we're going to stop here for today. For next class, please read the case study on Brooklyn's gentrification in your textbook, Chapter 8. We'll discuss specific examples and you'll see these patterns playing out in real neighborhoods. Any final questions?
