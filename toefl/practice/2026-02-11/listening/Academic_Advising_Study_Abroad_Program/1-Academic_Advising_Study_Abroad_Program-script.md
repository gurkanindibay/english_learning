### Campus Conversation: Academic Advising - Study Abroad Program

**Advisor (Female):** Hi there! Come on in. You must be Sarah - I have you down for a study abroad advising session.

**Student (Female):** Yes, that's me. Thanks for meeting with me. I'm interested in studying abroad next fall, but I'm honestly a bit overwhelmed with all the options and requirements.

**Advisor:** That's completely normal - there's a lot to consider. Let's start with the basics. What year are you, and what's your major?

**Student:** I'm a junior, majoring in Environmental Science with a minor in Spanish. I've been thinking about going to Costa Rica because it would combine both of my academic interests - they have amazing biodiversity there, and I could practice my Spanish.

**Advisor:** Costa Rica is an excellent choice for your field. We actually have two programs there. One is through the Organization for Tropical Studies - it's very research-intensive, field-based. The other is through the University of Costa Rica in San José, which offers traditional courses but also has field trip components. Have you looked into either of these?

**Student:** I browsed the OTS program online, and it looks incredible, but I noticed it's only for one semester. Would that interfere with my graduation timeline? I'm supposed to graduate in spring of my senior year.

**Advisor:** Good question. Let's check your degree requirements. Do you have your degree audit with you?

**Student:** Yes, I pulled it up this morning. *pause* It looks like I still need to complete two upper-level Environmental Science courses and one Spanish literature course.

**Advisor:** Okay, this is actually workable. The OTS program offers courses that can fulfill upper-level Environmental Science electives - their tropical ecology and conservation biology courses are pre-approved for credit here. However, you wouldn't be able to take Spanish literature courses there since OTS courses are taught in English, even though you're in Costa Rica.

**Student:** Oh, I didn't realize that. So I'd have to take the Spanish literature course either before I go or after I come back?

**Advisor:** Exactly. If you go in fall of your senior year, you'd need to take that Spanish course in spring of your senior year, which is your final semester. Or, you could take it this summer - we offer a couple of Spanish literature courses in the summer session.

**Student:** I was hoping to do an internship this summer with the Environmental Protection Agency. I already applied and I'm waiting to hear back.

**Advisor:** That's a great opportunity - internships are incredibly valuable. Here's another option to consider: you could study abroad in the spring semester instead of fall. That would give you the summer for your EPA internship and fall semester to complete any remaining coursework.

**Student:** Hmm, but wouldn't spring semester be during the dry season in Costa Rica? I thought the field research was better during the wet season.

**Advisor:** You're absolutely right - you've done your homework! The wet season is May through November, so fall semester would indeed be ideal for fieldwork. Let me suggest something else: what if you did a shorter program? We have a January intersession program in Costa Rica - it's three weeks, very intensive. It wouldn't replace a full semester abroad, but you could do that and still complete your coursework on schedule and do your summer internship.

**Student:** I didn't know we had intersession programs. Would that count toward my degree requirements?

**Advisor:** It would give you three credits, which could count as an elective, but it wouldn't fulfill the upper-level Environmental Science requirement - those courses need to be at least four credits. However, here's the advantage: intersession programs are often more affordable since you're only away for three weeks rather than four months. Plus, you'd still be on campus in the fall to complete your required courses.

**Student:** That does sound more manageable financially. My parents are supportive, but they're worried about the cost. How much are we talking for a full semester versus the intersession?

**Advisor:** For the full semester OTS program, you're looking at around 18,000 dollars for tuition, housing, and meals. Airfare and personal expenses would be additional. The intersession program runs about 4,500 dollars, all-inclusive except for airfare.

**Student:** Wow, that's a significant difference. But I feel like I'd get so much more out of a full semester...

**Advisor:** You definitely would in terms of cultural immersion and depth of study. Here's something to consider, though - have you looked into scholarships? We have several study abroad scholarships specifically for STEM majors, and there's also the Gilman Scholarship for students with financial need. The application deadline for fall programs is coming up - it's March 15th - but if you're competitive, you could potentially get 3,000 to 5,000 dollars in scholarship funding.

**Student:** I had no idea those existed. Is it complicated to apply?

**Advisor:** It requires some effort - you'll need to write a statement of purpose explaining how studying abroad connects to your academic and career goals, get a faculty recommendation, and submit a budget plan. But I've seen many students successfully receive these scholarships. Given your clear academic focus in Environmental Science and the fact that you're learning Spanish specifically to work in Latin American conservation - that's a compelling narrative.

**Student:** That would make a huge difference. Okay, so if I wanted to do the full semester OTS program in fall and apply for scholarships, what's my timeline?

**Advisor:** You'd need to submit your study abroad application by March 1st. The scholarship applications are due March 15th. If you're selected, you'd find out about scholarship funding by mid-April. The program itself starts in late August.

**Student:** And I'd need to figure out the Spanish literature course situation before then?

**Advisor:** Ideally, yes. I'd recommend scheduling a meeting with your Spanish department advisor to discuss options. You might also ask if any of your previous Spanish courses could substitute for the literature requirement - sometimes there's flexibility.

**Student:** This is really helpful. One last thing - what about housing? Would I live with a host family or in student housing?

**Advisor:** The OTS program uses a combination. You'd stay at their research stations, which have shared dormitory-style accommodations. It's pretty rustic - you'd be right in the rainforest. Then, during breaks between field sessions, you'd stay with a host family in San José. It's designed to give you both the immersive field research experience and cultural connections with Costa Rican families.

**Student:** That actually sounds amazing. I think I'm going to go for it - apply for the fall semester program and apply for scholarships. Can you send me the links for all the applications?

**Advisor:** Absolutely. I'll email you a comprehensive checklist with all the deadlines, application links, and scholarship information. Also, I'd recommend attending our study abroad fair next week on Wednesday - OTS has a representative coming, and you can ask them questions directly.

**Student:** Perfect. Thank you so much - I feel much less overwhelmed now!

**Advisor:** That's what I'm here for. Good luck with the applications, and feel free to schedule another appointment if you have more questions as you work through the process.
