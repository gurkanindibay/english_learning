## Passage 1: Campus Conversation

### 🎧 Audio Script - Academic Advising Appointment

**Advisor (Female):** Come in! You must be Jennifer. Please, have a seat.

**Student (Female):** Thank you, Professor Martinez. I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me.

**Advisor:** Of course! That's what I'm here for. So, I see from your email that you're thinking about changing your major from Business to Environmental Science. That's quite a shift! Tell me what's behind this decision.

**Student:** Well, I've been taking Business classes for the past year and a half, and honestly, I'm just not passionate about it anymore. Last semester, I took Environmental Studies as an elective, and it completely changed my perspective. I found myself actually excited about the readings and assignments, which hasn't happened with my Business courses.

**Advisor:** That's a really important realization. Passion definitely matters for long-term success. But I want to make sure you've thought through all the implications. Have you considered how much longer it might take to graduate if you switch majors now?

**Student:** That's actually my biggest concern. I'm currently a sophomore, so I'm halfway through. I'm worried I might need an extra year or even more.

**Advisor:** Let's look at your transcript together. You've completed... let me see... you have your general education requirements mostly done, which is good. And I see you took Chemistry 101 and Biology 150. Those actually count toward the Environmental Science major, so they won't go to waste.

**Student:** Really? I had no idea! I just took those for my science requirements.

**Advisor:** Yes, and that's going to help you. Environmental Science requires a strong foundation in natural sciences. Now, the major requires 45 credit hours of coursework - that's about 15 classes. You've already got... let me calculate... about 12 credits that will transfer over from your science classes and that Environmental Studies course.

**Student:** So I'd need 33 more credits?

**Advisor:** Exactly. That's 11 classes. If you take a full load each semester - that's typically 15 credits, or five classes - you could finish in three more semesters. That means you'd graduate one semester late, in December instead of May.

**Student:** One semester doesn't sound too bad. I was thinking it might be a whole year.

**Advisor:** It could be less if you're willing to take summer classes. The Environmental Science department offers several core courses during summer session. If you took two classes this coming summer, you could potentially still graduate on time next May.

**Student:** That would be amazing! But wouldn't summer classes be really expensive?

**Advisor:** They are an additional cost, yes. Each summer course is about $1,200. But compare that to the cost of an entire extra semester - tuition, housing, living expenses. Financially, summer classes actually save money if they help you graduate on time.

**Student:** That's a good point. What about my internship? I was planning to do a business internship this summer.

**Advisor:** Ah, that's something to consider. Here's what I'd suggest - and this is just a suggestion. You could take one summer class instead of two, which would leave you time for a part-time internship. It wouldn't have to be in business anymore. In fact, an environmental science or sustainability internship would look great on your resume and give you practical experience in your new field.

**Student:** I hadn't thought about that. Do you know if there are environmental internships available?

**Advisor:** Absolutely. The Career Center has listings, and I can also connect you with some of our Environmental Science faculty who have industry connections. Professor Chen, for example, works closely with the State Department of Natural Resources, and they often have summer intern positions.

**Student:** That sounds perfect. Okay, so if I take one summer class and then five classes each semester for the next two semesters, I'd still be one semester behind, right?

**Advisor:** Correct. You'd graduate in December. But let me ask - is graduating in May versus December a dealbreaker for you?

**Student:** I don't think so. Most job postings I've seen are year-round, not just for May graduates.

**Advisor:** That's true, especially in environmental fields. Many positions actually prefer January start dates because that's when new budgets kick in. There's one more thing you should know, though. Switching majors now means you need to formally apply to the Environmental Science program. It's not automatic.

**Student:** Oh, I didn't realize there was an application process. Is it competitive?

**Advisor:** Somewhat. They accept about 70% of applicants, and they mainly look at your GPA in science courses and a statement of purpose. Looking at your transcript, you got an A in Biology and a B+ in Chemistry, so you're in good shape academically. The statement is really about explaining your interest in the field and what you hope to achieve.

**Student:** When would I need to apply?

**Advisor:** The deadline for fall admission is March 15th, so you have about five weeks. I'd recommend starting your statement soon, maybe getting it reviewed by the Writing Center, and then you'll also need one letter of recommendation from a faculty member.

**Student:** Could I ask my Environmental Studies professor? I did really well in that class, and we had several good discussions during office hours.

**Advisor:** That would be ideal. They can speak to your genuine interest and academic ability in the field. Just make sure to ask them soon and give them at least three weeks before the deadline. Professors get a lot of these requests.

**Student:** Okay, this is all really helpful. I'm feeling a lot more confident about this decision now. Is there anything else I should be thinking about?

**Advisor:** Just one thing - make sure to officially declare your intent to change majors with the Registrar's Office, even before you get accepted to the Environmental Science program. That way, you won't accidentally register for Business classes next semester out of habit.

**Student:** Good point! I'll do that this week. Thank you so much for all your help, Professor Martinez.

**Advisor:** You're very welcome, Jennifer. Feel free to email me if you have any other questions as you go through this process. Good luck with your application!

**Student:** Thank you!

## Passage 2: Academic Lecture

### 🎧 Audio Script - Psychology: Sleep and Memory Consolidation

**Professor (Male):** Alright everyone, let's continue our discussion of memory. Last week we talked about how memories are encoded and stored. Today, I want to focus on something that might surprise you - the critical role that sleep plays in memory consolidation. And I'm not just talking about being well-rested so you can focus better. I'm talking about sleep as an active process that literally changes how memories are stored in your brain.

So, let's start with a question. How many of you have ever pulled an all-nighter before an exam?

**Student (Female):** I think we all have at some point.

**Professor:** Right, and how did that work out for you? Did you retain that information long-term?

**Student (Female):** Not really. I could remember things for the test, but a week later, I'd forgotten most of it.

**Professor:** Exactly, and there's a neurological reason for that. Here's what's happening. When you first learn something - let's say you're studying Spanish vocabulary - that information is initially stored in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is like a temporary storage facility in your brain. It's really good at quickly grabbing new information, but it has limited capacity.

For that information to become a stable, long-term memory - something you'll remember months or years later - it needs to be transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex, which is where long-term memories live. And this transfer process? It happens primarily during sleep.

Now, there are different stages of sleep, and each one plays a different role in memory. Non-REM sleep, particularly the deep stage called slow-wave sleep, is crucial for consolidating declarative memories. These are facts, events, information you can consciously recall - like those Spanish vocabulary words, or the dates of historical events, or concepts from this psychology class.

During slow-wave sleep, your brain essentially replays the neural patterns from your day. If you studied Spanish vocabulary during the day, your brain will reactivate those same neural pathways during slow-wave sleep, but in a more concentrated, organized way. This replay strengthens the synaptic connections, moving the information from temporary storage in the hippocampus to more permanent storage in the cortex.

**Student (Male):** So when people say "sleep on it" before making a decision, there's actually science behind that?

**Professor:** Absolutely! And it's not just about being well-rested. Your brain is literally processing and organizing information while you sleep. There's a famous study I want to tell you about. Researchers taught participants a complex finger-tapping sequence - kind of like learning to play a piano scale. One group practiced it and then slept that night. The other group practiced the same amount but stayed awake for an equivalent period.

The next day, both groups were tested. The group that slept showed significant improvement in both speed and accuracy, even though they hadn't practiced at all during that time. The group that stayed awake showed minimal improvement. The sleep group's brains had literally practiced the task during sleep, strengthening the motor memory.

Now, REM sleep - that's the stage where you dream - plays a different role. REM sleep seems to be particularly important for procedural memory and emotional memory. Procedural memory is the "how to" knowledge - riding a bike, playing an instrument, athletic skills. REM sleep helps integrate these skills and make them more automatic.

REM sleep also helps with emotional processing and creativity. You know how sometimes you'll wake up with the solution to a problem you couldn't figure out the day before? That's your brain making new connections during REM sleep. It's taking information you already have and combining it in novel ways.

There's also something called memory triage that happens during sleep. Your brain doesn't keep everything you experience during the day - that would be overwhelming and inefficient. During sleep, particularly during slow-wave sleep, your brain essentially decides what's important enough to keep and what can be discarded.

**Student (Female):** How does the brain know what's important?

**Professor:** Great question. It's based on several factors. Repetition is one - if you encountered the information multiple times, your brain flags it as probably important. Emotional significance is another - if something triggered a strong emotional response, that's a signal to keep it. And novelty matters too - really unique or unexpected information is more likely to be consolidated.

This is why cramming the night before an exam is so ineffective. You're not giving your brain time to do this sorting and consolidation process. You might remember things for the test the next morning, but that information is still sitting in your hippocampus in temporary storage. Without sleep to consolidate it, most of it will fade within days.

There's also fascinating research on sleep deprivation and false memories. When people are sleep-deprived, they're not only worse at remembering accurate information, they're also more likely to remember things that didn't actually happen. The brain starts filling in gaps incorrectly.

**Student (Male):** Is there an optimal amount of sleep for memory consolidation?

**Professor:** Most research suggests that adults need about 7 to 9 hours for optimal memory function. But it's not just total time - the quality and completeness of sleep cycles matters. You need to go through multiple complete cycles of both non-REM and REM sleep.

Here's something interesting - timing matters too. There's evidence that a full night of sleep after learning is more beneficial than the same amount of sleep before learning. Though obviously, being well-rested before learning helps with encoding. The ideal scenario is being well-rested before you learn something and then sleeping well afterward to consolidate it.

Now, let me tell you about the implications of all this. First, for your own studying - spacing out your study sessions over multiple days with sleep in between is far more effective than massed practice in one session. This is called the spacing effect, and it works partly because you're giving your brain multiple opportunities to consolidate the information during sleep.

Second, naps can help, but they work differently than nighttime sleep. A 90-minute nap can include some slow-wave sleep and even a bit of REM, which can aid consolidation. But shorter naps, while they can improve alertness and performance, don't include enough deep sleep cycles for significant memory consolidation.

Third, and this is really important for any of you considering pulling all-nighters - sleep deprivation doesn't just prevent new memories from forming well; it can also interfere with memories you've already consolidated. So you could actually damage knowledge you learned weeks ago by not sleeping well now.

Finally, there's emerging research on targeted memory reactivation. Scientists have found that if you associate specific information with a cue - like a particular sound or smell - and then present that cue during sleep, you can enhance consolidation of that specific information. This is still experimental, but it might have applications for learning in the future.

Okay, we need to wrap up for today. For next class, I want you to read Chapter 7 on amnesia and memory disorders. We'll discuss how studying these disorders has helped us understand normal memory function. Any questions before we finish?

**Student (Female):** Should we take naps before exams?

**Professor:** If you're well-rested and have been studying consistently with good sleep throughout, a short nap can help with alertness. But don't use it as a substitute for proper nighttime sleep. Your brain needs those full sleep cycles. See you next week!
