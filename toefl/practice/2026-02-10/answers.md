## Full Transcript - Passage 1: Research Ethics Committee Discussion

**Professor (Male):** Thanks for coming in, Michael. I wanted to discuss your research proposal before the Ethics Committee meeting next week. I've reviewed your methodology, and while the study design is quite innovative, I do have some concerns about the informed consent procedures you've outlined.

**Student (Male):** Oh, I thought I'd covered all the bases there. What specifically are you worried about?

**Professor:** Well, your study involves teenagers, right? Participants aged 13 to 17, examining the effects of social media on self-esteem. The issue isn't just getting parental consent - which you've addressed - but ensuring that the adolescents themselves truly understand what they're agreeing to. The psychological literature suggests that adolescents, particularly younger teens, may not fully grasp the implications of participating in longitudinal studies.

**Student:** I see your point. I have included an assent form in addition to the parental consent, written at a sixth-grade reading level. Isn't that standard practice?

**Professor:** It is, but here's where it gets tricky with your particular study. You're asking participants to grant you access to their social media accounts for a six-month period. That's a significant invasion of privacy, and the long-term implications might not be apparent to a 13-year-old. There's also the question of what happens if a participant posts something concerning - say, content suggesting self-harm or bullying. Do you have protocols in place for that?

**Student:** Hmm, I hadn't fully considered that scenario. I was planning to focus solely on quantitative metrics - number of posts, likes, time spent on platforms - not the actual content.

**Professor:** But can you really separate the two? If your research assistants are monitoring accounts, they'll inevitably see the content. This creates a duty of care issue. If you become aware of a participant in distress, you're ethically - and potentially legally - obligated to act. The committee will definitely ask about your crisis intervention procedures.

**Student:** That's a complication I didn't anticipate. Would it be better to have participants self-report their social media usage instead?

**Professor:** That would certainly simplify the ethical concerns, but it introduces reliability problems. Self-reported data on social media use is notoriously inaccurate. Studies have shown people underestimate their screen time by as much as 50%. You'd be undermining the validity of your entire study.

**Student:** So I'm caught between ethical complications and methodological validity. Is there a middle ground?

**Professor:** Potentially. Some researchers have used phone monitoring apps that collect usage data automatically but don't give researchers access to actual content. The data gets anonymized and aggregated. Participants would need to install the app, but it's less invasive than full account access. The downside is it only works for mobile usage, not desktop.

**Student:** But according to the Pew Research data, 95% of teens access social media primarily through mobile devices, so that might be acceptable. I'd need to revise my methodology section substantially, though.

**Professor:** True, but it would make your proposal much more defensible. There's another issue we should discuss - your recruitment strategy. You're planning to recruit through schools, correct?

**Student:** Yes, I've contacted several high schools in the district. I figure school-based recruitment gives me access to a diverse sample.

**Professor:** It does, but it also creates a subtle coercion problem. When recruitment happens in a school setting, students may feel pressure to participate, especially if they think it might affect their relationship with teachers or their academic standing. Even if you explicitly state participation is voluntary, the power dynamics are problematic.

**Student:** I hadn't thought of it that way. How do other researchers handle this?

**Professor:** Some use community-based recruitment instead - advertising through youth organizations, libraries, social media ads targeted to parents. It's more time-consuming and you might get a less representative sample, but it eliminates the coercion concern. Another option is to have a completely independent recruiter who has no affiliation with the schools.

**Student:** This is becoming more complicated than I anticipated. Do you think the committee will reject my proposal outright?

**Professor:** Not necessarily reject it, but they'll almost certainly ask for major revisions. The committee tends to be conservative when research involves minors. Look, your research question is important - understanding social media's impact on adolescent mental health is crucial. But you need to design the study in a way that prioritizes participant welfare. The best research is both rigorous and ethical.

**Student:** I appreciate your candor. Would you be willing to look at a revised proposal before I resubmit to the committee? I'm thinking I could switch to the app-based monitoring approach, develop clear crisis intervention protocols with a licensed counselor on the team, and explore community-based recruitment options.

**Professor:** Those all sound like moves in the right direction. Yes, send me a revised draft by the end of next week, and we can go over it together. I'd also suggest you look at Dr. Chen's 2024 study on teen digital behavior - she navigated similar ethical challenges quite elegantly. Her work might give you a template.

**Student:** I'll definitely check that out. One more question - given these changes, do you think I'll still be able to launch the study this semester, or am I looking at a significant delay?

**Professor:** If you can turn around revisions quickly and the committee approves in their March meeting, you might be able to start recruitment in April. That would give you time to collect data over the summer months when teens are more available. Honestly, taking the extra time to get the ethics right will make for a much stronger study in the long run.

**Student:** You're right. Better to delay and do it properly than rush and create problems down the line. Thanks for the guidance, Professor.

**Professor:** That's what I'm here for. Good luck with the revisions.

## Full Transcript - Passage 2: Art History - Impressionism and Modernism

**Professor (Female):** All right, let's continue our discussion of the transition from Impressionism to early Modernism. Last week we examined how the Impressionists broke with academic tradition by painting en plein air and capturing fleeting moments of light and atmosphere. Today, I want to explore a more subtle but equally revolutionary aspect of their work - how Impressionism fundamentally challenged conventional notions of perception itself.

**Professor:** Now, when we look at a Monet painting - let's say his "Impression, Sunrise" from 1872, the work that actually gave Impressionism its name - we're not just seeing a different painting technique. We're encountering a radically different philosophical position about the nature of visual experience. Traditional academic painting operated on the assumption that painting should represent objective reality - the world as it "really is." But here's the thing: Monet and his contemporaries were arguing that there is no single objective reality to represent. Instead, there are only subjective, momentary perceptions.

**Professor:** This might seem like a minor theoretical distinction, but it had profound implications. Think about it this way: if you and I look at the same cathedral at different times of day, under different lighting conditions, from different vantage points, are we seeing the same cathedral? Monet's series paintings - his haystacks, his Rouen Cathedral series, his water lilies - were essentially philosophical experiments exploring this question. He painted the same subject over and over under varying conditions to demonstrate that subject and perception are inseparable.

**Professor:** What's particularly interesting is how this parallels developments in other fields during the same period. In the 1870s and 80s, scientists like Hermann von Helmholtz were publishing research on the physiology of perception, demonstrating that what we "see" is actually a complex neurological construction, not a passive recording of external reality. The Impressionists may not have been reading Helmholtz, but they were visualizing the same insights. Art and science were converging on a new understanding of consciousness.

**Professor:** Now, this perceptual revolution set the stage for what came next - the move toward abstraction in early Modernism. Artists like Cézanne, who's often called the "father of modern art," took the Impressionist insight about subjective perception and pushed it even further. Cézanne wasn't satisfied with capturing momentary impressions. He wanted to represent what he called the "underlying structure" of perception - the way our minds organize visual information into geometric forms.

**Professor:** Look at his still lifes from the 1890s. Those apples aren't painted from a single viewpoint. If you analyze the perspective carefully, you'll notice that different objects in the same painting are viewed from slightly different angles. Cézanne is synthesizing multiple perceptual moments into a single image. He's not painting what he sees from one spot at one instant - he's painting his accumulated knowledge of the object, his mental model of it. This is a crucial conceptual leap that would lead directly to Cubism.

**Professor:** But here's where I want to push back against the standard art historical narrative. We often teach this as a progression: Impressionism led to Post-Impressionism, which led to Cubism, which led to abstraction - as if modern art evolved in a neat, linear fashion toward increasing abstraction. That's overly simplistic. The relationship between representation and abstraction has never been a one-way street.

**Professor:** Consider this: at the same time that Kandinsky was creating his first purely abstract works around 1910, you had artists like Edward Hopper in America painting highly realistic scenes. Both are considered modernists. Why? Because modernism isn't really about abstraction versus representation. It's about self-consciousness regarding the medium itself. Both Kandinsky and Hopper were deeply aware that they were making paintings, not windows onto reality. Their work acknowledges its own artifice, its own materiality.

**Professor:** This brings us to a critical point about how we analyze modernist art. We need to look beyond surface style and ask: what assumptions about art, perception, and reality is this work challenging? When Picasso paints "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" in 1907, shattering the picture plane with multiple perspectives and African mask-influenced faces, he's not just being visually radical. He's questioning Western art's claim to universal aesthetic standards. He's saying, "Why should European Renaissance perspective be the only valid way to represent space?"

**Professor:** Similarly, when Duchamp presents a urinal as art in 1917, he's posing a philosophical question: what makes something art? Is it the artist's skill, the beauty of the object, or simply the context and the act of designation? These aren't just provocations - they're serious epistemological inquiries using visual means.

**Professor:** Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, "This is becoming awfully abstract and theoretical. What about the paintings themselves?" Fair point. But here's why this theoretical framework matters: it helps us understand why modernist art provoked such intense reactions. When critics ridiculed Impressionist paintings or called Matisse's work "barbaric," they weren't just expressing aesthetic disapproval. They were feeling threatened by a fundamental challenge to their worldview.

**Professor:** Academic painting reflected Enlightenment values - rationality, objective truth, universal standards. Modernism, in its various forms, was suggesting that reality is more fragmented, subjective, and culturally contingent than the Enlightenment believed. In that sense, modernist art wasn't just a stylistic rebellion; it was a philosophical revolution.

**Professor:** Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a question to consider for our next session: if modernism challenged established notions of representation and reality, what happens in the postmodern period? What's left to challenge once all the traditional assumptions have been dismantled? We'll explore that on Wednesday. For now, take a look at the images I've uploaded to the course site - compare a Monet, a Cézanne, and an early Picasso. Try to articulate how each one relates to and departs from the others. See you Wednesday.
