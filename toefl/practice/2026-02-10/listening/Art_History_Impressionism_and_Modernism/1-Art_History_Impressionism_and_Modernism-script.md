### 🎧 Art History: Impressionism and Modernism

**Professor (Female):** All right, let's continue our discussion of the transition from Impressionism to early Modernism. Last week we examined how the Impressionists broke with academic tradition by painting en plein air and capturing fleeting moments of light and atmosphere. Today, I want to explore a more subtle but equally revolutionary aspect of their work - how Impressionism fundamentally challenged conventional notions of perception itself.

**Professor:** Now, when we look at a Monet painting - let's say his "Impression, Sunrise" from 1872, the work that actually gave Impressionism its name - we're not just seeing a different painting technique. We're encountering a radically different philosophical position about the nature of visual experience. Traditional academic painting operated on the assumption that painting should represent objective reality - the world as it "really is." But here's the thing: Monet and his contemporaries were arguing that there is no single objective reality to represent. Instead, there are only subjective, momentary perceptions.

**Professor:** This might seem like a minor theoretical distinction, but it had profound implications. Think about it this way: if you and I look at the same cathedral at different times of day, under different lighting conditions, from different vantage points, are we seeing the same cathedral? Monet's series paintings - his haystacks, his Rouen Cathedral series, his water lilies - were essentially philosophical experiments exploring this question. He painted the same subject over and over under varying conditions to demonstrate that subject and perception are inseparable.

**Professor:** What's particularly interesting is how this parallels developments in other fields during the same period. In the 1870s and 80s, scientists like Hermann von Helmholtz were publishing research on the physiology of perception, demonstrating that what we "see" is actually a complex neurological construction, not a passive recording of external reality. The Impressionists may not have been reading Helmholtz, but they were visualizing the same insights. Art and science were converging on a new understanding of consciousness.

**Professor:** Now, this perceptual revolution set the stage for what came next - the move toward abstraction in early Modernism. Artists like Cézanne, who's often called the "father of modern art," took the Impressionist insight about subjective perception and pushed it even further. Cézanne wasn't satisfied with capturing momentary impressions. He wanted to represent what he called the "underlying structure" of perception - the way our minds organize visual information into geometric forms.

**Professor:** Look at his still lifes from the 1890s. Those apples aren't painted from a single viewpoint. If you analyze the perspective carefully, you'll notice that different objects in the same painting are viewed from slightly different angles. Cézanne is synthesizing multiple perceptual moments into a single image. He's not painting what he sees from one spot at one instant - he's painting his accumulated knowledge of the object, his mental model of it. This is a crucial conceptual leap that would lead directly to Cubism.

**Professor:** But here's where I want to push back against the standard art historical narrative. We often teach this as a progression: Impressionism led to Post-Impressionism, which led to Cubism, which led to abstraction - as if modern art evolved in a neat, linear fashion toward increasing abstraction. That's overly simplistic. The relationship between representation and abstraction has never been a one-way street.

**Professor:** Consider this: at the same time that Kandinsky was creating his first purely abstract works around 1910, you had artists like Edward Hopper in America painting highly realistic scenes. Both are considered modernists. Why? Because modernism isn't really about abstraction versus representation. It's about self-consciousness regarding the medium itself. Both Kandinsky and Hopper were deeply aware that they were making paintings, not windows onto reality. Their work acknowledges its own artifice, its own materiality.

**Professor:** This brings us to a critical point about how we analyze modernist art. We need to look beyond surface style and ask: what assumptions about art, perception, and reality is this work challenging? When Picasso paints "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" in 1907, shattering the picture plane with multiple perspectives and African mask-influenced faces, he's not just being visually radical. He's questioning Western art's claim to universal aesthetic standards. He's saying, "Why should European Renaissance perspective be the only valid way to represent space?"

**Professor:** Similarly, when Duchamp presents a urinal as art in 1917, he's posing a philosophical question: what makes something art? Is it the artist's skill, the beauty of the object, or simply the context and the act of designation? These aren't just provocations - they're serious epistemological inquiries using visual means.

**Professor:** Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, "This is becoming awfully abstract and theoretical. What about the paintings themselves?" Fair point. But here's why this theoretical framework matters: it helps us understand why modernist art provoked such intense reactions. When critics ridiculed Impressionist paintings or called Matisse's work "barbaric," they weren't just expressing aesthetic disapproval. They were feeling threatened by a fundamental challenge to their worldview.

**Professor:** Academic painting reflected Enlightenment values - rationality, objective truth, universal standards. Modernism, in its various forms, was suggesting that reality is more fragmented, subjective, and culturally contingent than the Enlightenment believed. In that sense, modernist art wasn't just a stylistic rebellion; it was a philosophical revolution.

**Professor:** Before we wrap up, I want to leave you with a question to consider for our next session: if modernism challenged established notions of representation and reality, what happens in the postmodern period? What's left to challenge once all the traditional assumptions have been dismantled? We'll explore that on Wednesday. For now, take a look at the images I've uploaded to the course site - compare a Monet, a Cézanne, and an early Picasso. Try to articulate how each one relates to and departs from the others. See you Wednesday.
