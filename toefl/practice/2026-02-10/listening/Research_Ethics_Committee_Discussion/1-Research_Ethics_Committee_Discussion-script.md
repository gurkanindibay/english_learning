# Audio Script - Research Ethics Committee Discussion

### 🎧 Research Ethics Committee Discussion

**Professor (Male):** Thanks for coming in, Michael. I wanted to discuss your research proposal before the Ethics Committee meeting next week. I've reviewed your methodology, and while the study design is quite innovative, I do have some concerns about the informed consent procedures you've outlined.

**Student (Male):** Oh, I thought I'd covered all the bases there. What specifically are you worried about?

**Professor:** Well, your study involves teenagers, right? Participants aged 13 to 17, examining the effects of social media on self-esteem. The issue isn't just getting parental consent - which you've addressed - but ensuring that the adolescents themselves truly understand what they're agreeing to. The psychological literature suggests that adolescents, particularly younger teens, may not fully grasp the implications of participating in longitudinal studies.

**Student:** I see your point. I have included an assent form in addition to the parental consent, written at a sixth-grade reading level. Isn't that standard practice?

**Professor:** It is, but here's where it gets tricky with your particular study. You're asking participants to grant you access to their social media accounts for a six-month period. That's a significant invasion of privacy, and the long-term implications might not be apparent to a 13-year-old. There's also the question of what happens if a participant posts something concerning - say, content suggesting self-harm or bullying. Do you have protocols in place for that?

**Student:** Hmm, I hadn't fully considered that scenario. I was planning to focus solely on quantitative metrics - number of posts, likes, time spent on platforms - not the actual content.

**Professor:** But can you really separate the two? If your research assistants are monitoring accounts, they'll inevitably see the content. This creates a duty of care issue. If you become aware of a participant in distress, you're ethically - and potentially legally - obligated to act. The committee will definitely ask about your crisis intervention procedures.

**Student:** That's a complication I didn't anticipate. Would it be better to have participants self-report their social media usage instead?

**Professor:** That would certainly simplify the ethical concerns, but it introduces reliability problems. Self-reported data on social media use is notoriously inaccurate. Studies have shown people underestimate their screen time by as much as 50%. You'd be undermining the validity of your entire study.

**Student:** So I'm caught between ethical complications and methodological validity. Is there a middle ground?

**Professor:** Potentially. Some researchers have used phone monitoring apps that collect usage data automatically but don't give researchers access to actual content. The data gets anonymized and aggregated. Participants would need to install the app, but it's less invasive than full account access. The downside is it only works for mobile usage, not desktop.

**Student:** But according to the Pew Research data, 95% of teens access social media primarily through mobile devices, so that might be acceptable. I'd need to revise my methodology section substantially, though.

**Professor:** True, but it would make your proposal much more defensible. There's another issue we should discuss - your recruitment strategy. You're planning to recruit through schools, correct?

**Student:** Yes, I've contacted several high schools in the district. I figure school-based recruitment gives me access to a diverse sample.

**Professor:** It does, but it also creates a subtle coercion problem. When recruitment happens in a school setting, students may feel pressure to participate, especially if they think it might affect their relationship with teachers or their academic standing. Even if you explicitly state participation is voluntary, the power dynamics are problematic.

**Student:** I hadn't thought of it that way. How do other researchers handle this?

**Professor:** Some use community-based recruitment instead - advertising through youth organizations, libraries, social media ads targeted to parents. It's more time-consuming and you might get a less representative sample, but it eliminates the coercion concern. Another option is to have a completely independent recruiter who has no affiliation with the schools.

**Student:** This is becoming more complicated than I anticipated. Do you think the committee will reject my proposal outright?

**Professor:** Not necessarily reject it, but they'll almost certainly ask for major revisions. The committee tends to be conservative when research involves minors. Look, your research question is important - understanding social media's impact on adolescent mental health is crucial. But you need to design the study in a way that prioritizes participant welfare. The best research is both rigorous and ethical.

**Student:** I appreciate your candor. Would you be willing to look at a revised proposal before I resubmit to the committee? I'm thinking I could switch to the app-based monitoring approach, develop clear crisis intervention protocols with a licensed counselor on the team, and explore community-based recruitment options.

**Professor:** Those all sound like moves in the right direction. Yes, send me a revised draft by the end of next week, and we can go over it together. I'd also suggest you look at Dr. Chen's 2024 study on teen digital behavior - she navigated similar ethical challenges quite elegantly. Her work might give you a template.

**Student:** I'll definitely check that out. One more question - given these changes, do you think I'll still be able to launch the study this semester, or am I looking at a significant delay?

**Professor:** If you can turn around revisions quickly and the committee approves in their March meeting, you might be able to start recruitment in April. That would give you time to collect data over the summer months when teens are more available. Honestly, taking the extra time to get the ethics right will make for a much stronger study in the long run.

**Student:** You're right. Better to delay and do it properly than rush and create problems down the line. Thanks for the guidance, Professor.

**Professor:** That's what I'm here for. Good luck with the revisions.
