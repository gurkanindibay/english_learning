## File Types (Within Each Date Directory)

### 1. script.md
- **Purpose:** Source file for audio generation
- **Contains:** Only dialogue/lecture scripts with speaker labels
- **Usage:** Input file for `generate_listening_audio.py`
- **DO NOT use during practice** - contains the full text you'll be listening to

### 2. questions.md ⭐
- **Purpose:** Practice materials (use this!)
- **Contains:** 
  - Instructions
  - Audio file references
  - All questions with multiple choice options
  - Note-taking templates
  - **NO transcripts or answers**
- **Usage:** Open this file while doing your practice
- **Result:** You can test yourself without seeing answers

### 3. answers.md

- **Contains:**
  - Complete answer key with explanations
  - Full transcripts of all passages
  - Error analysis worksheets
  - Vocabulary lists
  - Study tips

- **Important:** Don't peek! This defeats the purpose

### 4. audio/ directory
- **Purpose:** Generated MP3 audio files
- **Contains:** One MP3 file per passage
- **Usage:** Play these files during practice
- **Generated by:** Running the audio generation script

## How to Practice

### Step 1: Generate Audio (if not already created)
```bash
cd ../../scripts
venv/bin/python generate_listening_audio.py \
  ../toefl/practice/2026-02-08/script.md \
  -o ../toefl/practice/2026-02-08/audio
```

### Step 2: Prepare for Practice
- Open the **questions.md** file in the date directory
- Get paper for Cornell-style notes (cues | notes | summary)
- Have a timer ready
- Close all answer files!

### Step 3: Listen and Answer
1. Play audio files from the `audio/` subdirectory
2. Take notes while listening (no pausing!)
3. Answer all questions in the questions.md file
4. Calculate your score

### Step 4: Review
1. Open the **answers.md** file in the same date directory
2. Check your answers
3. Read explanations for incorrect answers
4. Review full transcripts for difficult passages
5. Complete error analysis
6. Add new vocabulary to your vocabulary.md

## File Naming Convention

All files for a practice session are organized within a date-based directory:

**Directory format:** `YYYY-MM-DD/` (e.g., `2026-02-08/`)

**Files within each directory:**
- `script.md` - Audio script for generation
- `questions.md` - Questions for practice
- `answers.md` - Answers with transcripts
- `audio/` - Subdirectory containing MP3 files

**Audio files:** Named after passage titles (e.g., `Library_Research_Consultation.mp3`)

## Audio Generation

Audio files are automatically created from script files using the `generate_listening_audio.py` script with Microsoft Edge TTS:

- **Female voice:** en-US-AriaNeural (clear, friendly)
- **Male voice:** en-US-GuyNeural (professional, clear)
- **Format:** MP3, 128kbps
- **Auto-detection:** Gender from labels like `(Female)` or `(Male)`

### Generating Audio for a Practice Session

```bash
cd scripts
venv/bin/python generate_listening_audio.py \
  ../toefl/practice/YYYY-MM-DD/script.md \
  -o ../toefl/practice/YYYY-MM-DD/audio
```

This creates MP3 files in the practice session's `audio/` subdirectory.

## Practice Schedule

Follow your [TOEFL study plan](../../toefl_study_plan.md) for recommended practice frequency:

- **Weekdays:** 1 hour (typically 1-2 passages)
- **Weekends:** 1.5 hours (2-3 passages)
- **Goal:** 44% of total study time on listening

## Tips for Success

### Before Listening
- Review topic vocabulary if provided
- Set up Cornell notes
- Get ready to focus (no distractions!)

### During Listening
- Focus on main ideas, not every word
- Use abbreviations (w/ = with, b/c = because, → = leads to)
- Note speaker transitions and signal words
- Don't panic if you miss something - keep listening

### After Listening
- Answer questions immediately while information is fresh
- Use your notes, not memory
- Don't replay audio - simulate test conditions
- Check answers only after completing all questions

## Error Analysis

After each practice session:

1. **Calculate accuracy:** ___/total = ___%
2. **Identify patterns:** What question types did you miss?
3. **Review notes:** What information was missing?
4. **Learn vocabulary:** Add unknown words to vocabulary.md
5. **Plan improvements:** What will you do differently next time?

## Integration with Other Materials

- **Vocabulary:** Add new words from listening to `/vocabulary.md`
- **Grammar:** Note interesting grammatical structures in `/grammar/`
- **Study Plan:** Track progress in `/toefl_study_plan.md`
- **Audio Scripts:** Located in `/scripts/` directory

## Creating New Practice Materials

When @listening_tutor creates new practice:

1. Creates date directory → `practice/YYYY-MM-DD/`
2. Creates script file → `YYYY-MM-DD/script.md`
3. Generates audio → runs `generate_listening_audio.py` → outputs to `YYYY-MM-DD/audio/`
4. Creates questions file → `YYYY-MM-DD/questions.md` (no transcripts)
5. Creates answers file → `YYYY-MM-DD/answers.md` (with transcripts)

This ensures you can practice effectively without seeing answers prematurely!

**Remember:** The key to improving listening comprehension is regular practice with proper self-evaluation. Use the questions file during practice, then honestly check your work with the answers file. Good luck! 🎧
