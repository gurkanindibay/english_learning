## Detailed Strategy by Section

### 🎧 Listening Strategy (19 → 25+)

#### Skill Development Focus
1. **Note-Taking System**
   - Cornell note method
   - Use symbols and abbreviations
   - Capture main ideas vs. details
   - Practice while listening

2. **Signal Words Recognition**
   - Transition markers (however, therefore, in contrast)
   - Emphasis cues (importantly, significantly, the key point)
   - Opinion indicators (I believe, arguably, surprisingly)

3. **Question Type Strategies**
   - Main idea: Focus on intro and conclusion
   - Detail: Note specific examples and facts
   - Function: Why does professor mention X?
   - Attitude: Pay attention to tone and word choice
   - Inference: Combine stated information

#### Practice Materials Needed
- Academic lectures: Science, history, arts, social sciences
- Campus conversations: Student services, academic discussions
- Various accents: American, British, Australian

#### Weekly Milestones
- Week 1-2: Build note-taking system, identify weaknesses
- Week 3-4: Master signal word recognition, improve accuracy 15%
