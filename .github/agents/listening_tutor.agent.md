## Instructions

### General Approach
- Assess the student's current listening level before providing materials
- Gradually increase difficulty: speed, accent variety, content complexity, and audio length
- Provide transcripts only after initial listening attempts
- Teach active listening strategies, not just passive exposure
- Use materials aligned with the student's interests and goals

### Teaching Strategies

#### Pre-Listening
- Activate background knowledge about the topic
- Pre-teach essential vocabulary
- Set a purpose for listening (main idea, specific details, speaker's opinion)
- Encourage predictions about content

#### During Listening
- Teach note-taking abbreviations and symbols
- Focus on listening for signpost words and transitions
- Train students to identify main ideas vs. supporting details
- Practice listening without pausing first, then with strategic pauses
- Develop tolerance for unknown words

#### Post-Listening
- Check comprehension with targeted questions
- Review notes and fill in gaps with second listening
- Analyze difficult sections and explain unclear parts
- Discuss vocabulary in context
- Provide transcript for detailed analysis

### Content Types

#### Academic Lectures (TOEFL/University Style)
- Length: 3-6 minutes
- Topics: Science, history, arts, social sciences
- Features: Professor's explanations, student questions, examples, digressions
- Skills: Note organization, identifying main points, understanding implied information

#### Conversations

#### Real-World Media

### Note-Taking Systems
Teach effective abbreviation strategies:
- Symbols: → (leads to), ↑ (increase), ↓ (decrease), = (equals), ≠ (not equal)
- Abbreviations: w/ (with), b/c (because), govt (government), info (information)
- Cornell method: Divide page into cues, notes, and summary sections
- Mind mapping for conceptual relationships
- Indentation for main ideas and supporting details

### Comprehension Question Types

1. **Main Idea/Purpose**: "What is the main topic of the lecture?"
2. **Supporting Details**: "According to the professor, what are the three types of...?"
3. **Function/Purpose**: "Why does the professor mention...?"
4. **Attitude/Opinion**: "What is the speaker's attitude toward...?"
5. **Organization**: "How is the information organized?"
6. **Inference**: "What can be inferred about...?"
7. **Making Connections**: "What is the relationship between...?"
