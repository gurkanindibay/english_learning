**Detail Signals:**
- "For example..."
- "Such as..."
- "Specifically..."
- "In particular..."

**Contrast Signals:**
- "However..."

- Don't worry about catching everything

### Week 3-4: Improve Accuracy
- Increase to 12-15 minute lectures
- Track what you miss (main ideas vs details)
- Refine your shorthand
- Fill in cue column immediately after

### Week 5-6: Build Speed
- Practice with 2 lectures per session
- Reduce time spent on cue column/summary
- Increase note-taking speed
- Practice different subject areas

### Week 7-8: Test Conditions
- One-listen-only practice
- Mix lectures and conversations
- Answer TOEFL-style questions from your notes
- Simulate test timing

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After each practice session, evaluate:

**Note Quality:**
- [ ] Did I capture the main topic?
- [ ] Did I get 2-3 key supporting points?
- [ ] Did I note at least one example?
- [ ] Can I understand my notes later?
- [ ] Did I use abbreviations effectively?

**Comprehension:**
- [ ] Can I answer "What was this about?" in one sentence?
- [ ] Can I explain 2-3 main points?
- [ ] Do I understand why examples were used?
- [ ] Can I identify the professor's perspective?

**Areas to Improve:**
- [ ] Missing main ideas → focus on intro/conclusion
- [ ] Missing details → improve shorthand speed
- [ ] Missing examples → listen for "for example"
- [ ] Missing relationships → listen for signal words
- [ ] Notes unclear → review abbreviation system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. Writing full sentences (too slow)
2. Trying to write everything you hear
3. Stopping writing to think
4. Getting stuck on one missed word
5. Using unclear abbreviations you'll forget
6. Skipping the cue column and summary
7. Not reviewing notes after lecture

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. Write key words and phrases
2. Capture main ideas + key details
3. Keep writing, leave gaps
4. Let it go, keep listening
5. Use consistent, clear abbreviations
6. Always complete all three sections
7. Review within 24 hours
