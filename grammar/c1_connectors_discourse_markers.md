# C1 Level Connectors and Discourse Markers

Advanced connectors are essential for C1-level fluency. They show sophisticated thinking and improve coherence in both speaking and writing. Use them naturally, not excessively.

## **CONTRAST & CONCESSION**

### **Strong Contrast**
- **whereas** = *"Traditional classes require attendance, whereas online courses offer flexibility."*
- **while** = *"While some argue for technology, others prefer traditional methods."*
- **on the other hand** = *"On the other hand, this approach has significant drawbacks."*
- **conversely** = *"Team projects build collaboration. Conversely, individual work develops self-reliance."*
- **in contrast** = *"In contrast to previous findings, this study shows different results."*

### **Unexpected/Concessive Contrast**
- **nevertheless** = *"The plan was risky; nevertheless, they proceeded."*
- **nonetheless** = *"The evidence is limited. Nonetheless, the conclusion appears valid."*

  > 💡 **Difference:** *Nevertheless* and *nonetheless* are identical. *Nevertheless* is slightly more common.

- **even so** = *"The weather was terrible. Even so, the event was successful."*
- **having said that** = *"The theory is complex. Having said that, it's worth understanding."*
- **that said** = *"The method works well. That said, it has some limitations."*

  > 💡 **Difference:** *Yet* = conjunction (use with comma). *Still* = adverb (needs semicolon/period before + comma after). Both show unexpected contrast.

## **TOEFL Speaking & Writing Tips**

- Use **2-3 different connectors** per response/essay
- Vary your choices—don't repeat the same connector
- For Speaking: Practice saying them naturally (not robotically)
- For Writing: Use formal connectors (moreover, furthermore, notwithstanding)
- Avoid overuse: Quality over quantity
